# Low-resolution, detailed CI tests

This document collects together tests of various use cases for GEMINI demonstrating a rangeo of grids and solvers.  These can be useful reference cases to build off of or can be used to do comprehensive testing of a new deployment of GEMINI.  These tests are designed to all be runnable as a 24 hour batch job on one HPC node (~20 cores).

# The GDI_periodic_highres_large example

This example is based on that published in Deshpande and Zettergren, 2019.  

The background density (given from the equilibrium simulation RISR_eq) is about 2.1e10

May want to consider adding a stretched grid in x2 to eliminate potential boundary affects on the simulations.

The grid is such that it can be divided into 20x18 subdomains so that it runs well on VEGA.  This is results in a grid of 64x1540x1062 - just over 100M grid points.
